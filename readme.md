# Markly

A parser and abstract syntax tree for Markdown documents (CommonMark compatible) in Ruby. Originally forked from
[CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker). It also includes extensions to the CommonMark spec as
documented in the [GitHub Flavored Markdown spec](http://github.github.com/gfm/), such as support for tables,
strikethroughs, and autolinking.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/ioquatix/markly/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ioquatix/markly/actions?workflow=Test)

## Motivation

This code base was originally forked from [Commonmarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) before they
switched from `cmark-gfm` (C) to `comrak` (Rust). The original implementation provided access to the abstract syntax
tree (AST), which is useful for building tools on top of Markdown. The Rust implementation did not provide this
functionality, and so this fork was created to continue to provide these (and more) features.

It should be noted that `commonmarker` re-introduced AST access, but the original C implementation in this fork is [3-4x faster at processing Markdown into HTML](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks) and has a more advanced HTML generation and AST processing features.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://ioquatix.github.io/markly/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://ioquatix.github.io/markly/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains now to install and use Markly.

  - [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://ioquatix.github.io/markly/guides/abstract-syntax-tree/index) - This guide explains how to use Markly's abstract syntax tree (AST) to parse and manipulate Markdown documents.

  - [Headings](https://ioquatix.github.io/markly/guides/headings/index) - This guide explains how to work with headings in Markly, including extracting them for navigation and handling duplicate heading text.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://ioquatix.github.io/markly/releases/index) for all releases.

### v0.15.1

  - Add agent context.

### v0.15.0

  - Introduced `Markly::Renderer::Headings` class for extracting headings from markdown documents with automatic duplicate ID resolution. When rendering HTML with `ids: true`, duplicate heading text now automatically gets unique IDs (`deployment`, `deployment-2`, `deployment-3`). The `Headings` class can also be used to extract headings for building navigation or table of contents.

### v0.14.0

  - Expose `Markly::Renderer::HTML.anchor_for` method to generate URL-safe anchors from headers.
