# Markly

A parser and abstract syntax tree for Markdown documents (CommonMark compatible) in Ruby. Originally forked from
[CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker). It also includes extensions to the CommonMark spec as
documented in the [GitHub Flavored Markdown spec](http://github.github.com/gfm/), such as support for tables,
strikethroughs, and autolinking.

## Motivation

This code base was originally forked from [Commonmarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) before they
switched from `cmark-gfm` (C) to `comrak` (Rust). The original implementation provided access to the abstract syntax
tree (AST), which is useful for building tools on top of Markdown. The Rust implementation does not provide this
functionality, and so this fork was created to continue to provide these (and more) features.

## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://ioquatix.github.io/markly/) for more details.
